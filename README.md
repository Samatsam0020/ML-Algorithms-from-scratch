# 📚 Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch** repository! 🚀 In this project, I implement foundational machine learning algorithms entirely from scratch using Python 🐍. The goal is to deepen understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood. 

## ✨ Features

Here are the algorithms implemented so far:

- 🔍 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- 🌳 **Decision Tree**
- 📈 **Linear Regression**
- 🤖 **Perceptron**
- 📊 More coming soon... stay tuned! 🛠️

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

This repository is built with simplicity in mind. It uses:

- **Python** (Core programming)
- **NumPy** (For efficient numerical computations) ⚡

No pre-built ML libraries like Scikit-learn are used—because we’re doing it from scratch! 🛡️

## 🧠 Why Build from Scratch?

Understanding the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms is crucial for:

- 📖 Gaining deep insights into their workings
- 🛠️ Debugging complex models
- 🎯 Optimizing performance
- 🚪 Opening doors to advanced topics like model customization
